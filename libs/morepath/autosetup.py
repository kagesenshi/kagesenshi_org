    """Automatically load Morepath configuration from packages.

    Morepath configuration consists of decorator calls on :class:`App`
    instances, i.e. ``@app.view()`` and ``@app.path()``.

    This function loads all needed Morepath configuration from all
    packages automatically. These packages do need to be made
    available using a ``setup.py`` file including currect
    ``install_requires`` information so that they can be found using
    setuptools_.

    .. _setuptools: http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/

    Creates a :class:`Config` object as with :func:`setup`, but before
    returning it scans all packages, looking for those that depend on
    Morepath directly or indirectly. This includes the package that
    calls this function. Those packages are then scanned for
    configuration as with :meth:`Config.scan`.

    You can add manual :meth:`Config.scan` calls yourself on the
    returned :class:`Config` object. Finally you need to call
    :meth:`Config.commit` on the returned :class:`Config` object so
    the configuration is committed.

    Typically called immediately after startup just before the
    application starts serving using WSGI.

    See also :func:`autosetup`.

    :param ignore: Venusian_ style ignore to ignore some modules
      during scanning. Optional.
    :returns: :class:`Config` object.
