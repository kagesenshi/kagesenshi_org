"""Sphinx extension to make sure directives have proper signatures.

This is tricky as directives are added as methods to the ``AppBase``
object using the directive decorator, and the signature needs to be
obtained from the directive class's ``__init__`` manually. In addition
this signature has a first argument (``app``) that needs to be
removed.
